# webengineer_subject_finalproject-app-laravel
This was my final project in the web engineering class. The app is an e-commerce platform for a date palm business, with customer modules for buying stuff and employee sections for managing crops, etc. It's the first project where I bothered with full documentation for all the stages of development.
